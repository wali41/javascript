        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chinese Cuisine</h2>
        <p>
            Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse
            regions of China,
            as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical
            power of the country,
            Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local
            palates. Chinese food staples
            such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be
            found worldwide.
